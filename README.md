- 👋 Hi, I’m @The-Programmer-05. I am a highschool student and a bit new to programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and hopefully founding, creating, or inventing something new that would be helpful and fun for people to use in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ruby script and a little python, i may start with java script in the near future.
- 💞️ I dont know how to collaborate and still in the learning process, but when i become more experinced I will try to collaberate with whatever seems interesting to me.
- 📫 I wont put contact info for now, but I am looking forward to meat new people who share the same interests as me to communicate and talk to.
-Thank you, and I wish everyone good luck on whatever you are doing, programming or not, in the present or future, I will you all the best.
